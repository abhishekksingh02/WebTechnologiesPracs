/*
    Sync in Js:
    Synchronous: Synchronous means the code runs in particular sequence of instruction given in program.
    Each instruction wait for the previous instruction to complete its execution

    Asynchronous:
    Due to synchronous programming sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some prevous instructions
    which causes a delay in the UI. Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instruction immediately
    and doesnt block the flow
